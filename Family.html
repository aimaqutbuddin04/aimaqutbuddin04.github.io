    Meet my Parents! <br>
    My mom's name is Azmat Karim and my dad's is Muhammad Qutbuddin.<br>
    I can definitely say that I have a very close relationship with my mother. She is someone I can depend on for anything!<br>
        My dad is a very hardworking man, who puts family over everything. He might also be the goofiest person I know.

    Although I have a smaller immediate family my extended family is <b>HUGE</b>!
    I have 5 uncles and 4 aunts on <u>only</u> my mom side of the family not to forget my bus full of cousins!<br>
    Just like many, I have a few cousins super close to me. We all get along great and never stop laughing around each other.<br>
    <br>

   <br> My entire family is crazy and chaotic but I wouldn't trade them for the world.
