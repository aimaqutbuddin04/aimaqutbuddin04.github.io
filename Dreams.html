One characteristic that makes me Aima, is my constant want to move ahead and be successful in everything I do.<br>
 I am only a freshman in High School but I kind of already know my interests and what I'd like to pursue in college. <br>
My electives for the next three years 'til graduation will consist of business and technology focused subjects.<br>
I want to go to <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu">Northwestern University</a> and gain every experiences I can to help me excel when I'm in the work force.<br>
 But I won't stop there, I will travel the world, help others in need, road trip across the entire country just for the sake of it.<br>
    One thing I'd like to do soon would be to see a movie in a outside theatre.If you wanna know more about my favorite movies click <a href="movies.html">here.</a>
My dream is to make my parents proud of having yet another successful daughter.<br>
    My dream is to never be held back because of my race,religion,or gender.<br>
My dream is to be a woman making it in a man's world.<br>
My dream is to gain respect for my capabilities not just my title.<br>
My dream is to have a family and inspire my own children to do wonderful things.<br>
My dream is also to stay humble and always have a big heart.<br>
My dream is to accomplish so much in so little time.<br>
